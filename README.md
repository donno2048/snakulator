If you run this code (_main.py_) in whitespace it will function as a calculator (type numbers, when you type -1 you will get the sum) and in Python, it's a snake game (use the asdw keys).

You can view the [online demo](https://donno2048.github.io/snakulator) for the whitespace.

This kind of program is called a [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing))

You can view an awesome polyglot in [another repo of mine](https://github.com/donno2048/Quines/tree/main/mul)
